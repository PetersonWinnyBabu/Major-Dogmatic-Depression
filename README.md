# Major-Dogmatic-Depression

Hi! I am trying to create a text based adventure game that raises awarness about Major Depressive Disorder (MDD). MDD is a mental illness that is quite often very misunderstood. People suffering from often feel like other people do not understand their struggles. I hope that this game sheds some light on those struggles and brings a smile to the player's face. The game is heavily inspired from "Adventures with Anxiety" https://ncase.me/anxiety/ and https://youtu.be/R1S_NhKkvGA for his helpful tutorials. 

Please reach out to me at imsiddg@gmail.com if you would like to help me further develop this game. I am actively looking for help. Thank for reading this and hope you have fun playing the game :P All feedback is very much appreciated
